# Webscrap-using-playwright
This project is a web scraping and keyword analysis tool that extracts text content from websites and analyzes it for specific keywords using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with spaCy. It uses requests and BeautifulSoup to fetch and parse webpage content, then performs exact and semantic keyword matching to determine relevance. The results are processed concurrently using ThreadPoolExecutor for efficiency and saved to an Excel report for further analysis.
